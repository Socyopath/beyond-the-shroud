# Covenants Events
utopia.2658.desc: "Time has passed since we established the foundation of a covenant with the §Y[BtsGetShroudPatron]§!. Our bond is still weak, and we still have a chance to break it - or alternatively, strengthen our connection."
utopia.2658.b: "Renounce the §Y[BtsGetShroudPatron]§!."
utopia.2671.desc: "Our understanding of our patron grows. We are no more than an afterthought to it. Insects in its home. Yet, it has taken a liking to us and on this occasion, it has bestowed another drop of power upon us.\n\nOur telepaths are now more closely attuned to our patron, and we have been inspired to create a monument to celebrate our covenant, a place where our best telepaths can try to commune with the §Y[BtsGetShroudPatron]§!."
utopia.2676.desc: "The mysteries of the Shroud are too alien for us to dispel, but we have become more attuned to the §Y[BtsGetShroudPatron]§!. Everywhere we go, we can sense it at the back of our minds, and its power seeps into our reality from the cracks of our psyche." 
utopia.2681.desc: "Our patron, the §Y[BtsGetShroudPatron]§! seems to have relinquished a fraction of its energy in a fold of the Shroud.

A few candidates were selected, but only one of them can be granted the privilege to wield the power of our patron. Who shall it be?"
utopia.2682.desc: "It is done. As the power was invested in [chosen_leader.GetName], all those around could feel the weight of its psionic presence. It is powerful and commands respect. [chosen_leader.GetHeShe] will now be the immortal champion of the §Y[BtsGetShroudPatron]§!."
utopia.2686.desc: "The conclave of Telepaths has made a breakthrough in harnessing the powers of our patron, the §Y[BtsGetShroudPatron]§!. Where previously only psionic individuals could fully grasp the extent of the Covenant, we have devised a way to let power flow through entire starships, at a scale never seen before.
